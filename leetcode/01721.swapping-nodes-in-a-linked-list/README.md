# [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

## 题目 - 交换链表中的节点

You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

Return the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the `kth` node from the beginning and the `kth` node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**).

**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
    Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

**Example 2:**

    Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
    Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is n.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 10⁵
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100
